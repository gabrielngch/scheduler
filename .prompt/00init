Read PLANS.md in .agents to understand how to plan.

Plan for a scheduler that runs python functions on a schedule. This will be a dockerised service that can run on the cloud (AWS, Hetzner) alongside cloud applications that require scheduled function runs.

Perhaps I have a function fn(inputs) -> outputs in Python. To schedule I could write in the definition

@schedule(how often)
def fn(input) -> output:
	bla bla

and there should be some bot (itself scheduled I guess) that reads through all the functions in the cloud space and schedules ones that haven't been scheduled.
This could be through some config where you point the scheduler to a folder, or just do it for all folders.

This means you will need a way to keep track of all the scheduled functions. You could hold a simple file that keeps strings to parse. The scheduler will then read this every so often and run the scheduled functions.

You want to store logs for the scheduler. This means on each run you should collect some simple statistics (expected functions, passed, failed, repeated, etc.)and store them.

In addition to this, you should write a really simple front end to monitor said logs.
